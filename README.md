# my ancient assignments C++/Java
some different tasks that i solve while learning java:
1) CollatzConjecture.java - The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. Program returns the number of steps up to a closed infinite loop of any selected number.
2) FileOps.java - oscilloscope files renamer.
3) oscilly_cs137.cpp - the program looking for a peaks in the energy spectrum for the isotope Cs137.
4) Febonnachi.java - java class which returns number in a series of fibonacci numbers at N position.
